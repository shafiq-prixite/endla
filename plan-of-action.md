Plan of attack:

1. warnings
2. code logic
3. UI/UX

Plan Execution:

First I run the project and checked a lot of issues and warnings in the console.
I checked in to the instructions and started to work on Account settings page where I checked some errors and warnings in the console.
First I resolved those warnings.

Then I checked the code quality and corrected some errors and logic like checkbox enabled check.

Then I checked in to the design which was not looking good and started thinking on how can I improve this so that it accomodate less space and can accept future changes easily in efficient way.

The Account settings page was taking too much space initially and it was not looking nice to me so I decided to change the overall look and feel.

I converted the page into different sections and the tabs were best fit according to the situation.

I designed tabs in React-bootstrap which was already used in the project and improved each section design.
